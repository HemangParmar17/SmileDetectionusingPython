Steps:

Load Images(Front Faces) or Capture video using webcame. Convert images into grayscale(Black & White). Train the algorithm to detect Faces.

opencv -> OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. haarcascade -> Haar Cascade is a machine learning-based approach where a lot of positive and negative images are used to train the classifier.
